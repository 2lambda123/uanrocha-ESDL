  Ecosystems around the world are at risk of critical transitions due to increasing
  anthropogenic pressures and climate change. Yet it is unclear where the risks are higher or where in the world ecosystems are more vulnerable. Here I measure resilience of primary productivity proxies for marine and terrestrial ecosystems globally. Up to 29% of global terrestrial ecosystem, and 24% marine ones, show symptoms of resilience loss. These symptoms are shown in all biomes, but Arctic tundra and boreal forest are the most affected, as well as the Indian Ocean and Eastern Pacific. Although the results are likely an underestimation, they enable the identification of risk areas as well as the potential synchrony of some transitions, helping prioritize areas for management interventions and conservation.

Ecosystems are prone to non-linear dynamics that can shift their function and
structure from one configuration to another [@Scheffer:2009p4449;
@Anonymous:2004bq]. Examples of such regime shifts include the transitions
from forest to savannas [@Hirota:2011p7120], the collapse of coral reefs
[@Hughes:2017bs], kelp forest to urchin barrens [@Ling:2015dra], peatland
transitions [@Turetsky:2015fn], or the emergence of hypoxic dead zones in
coastal systems [@Breitburg:2018iz; @Diaz:2008p199]. Over 30 different types
of regime shifts at the ecosystem scale have been reported in the literature
[@Biggs:2018hx]. Because regime shifts can be hard to reverse [@Hastings:2010p5336]  and can impact the services that society gets from ecosystems [@Carpenter:2009jr], predicting regime shifts is a policy relevant endeavour. Even imperfect predictions can help society to prepare for navigating some of these transitions, or avoid them when possible. Yet predicting when and where they will occur remains
challenging for most ecosystems [@Dakos:2015jt]. Understanding this is
deeply related to our ability to observe and measure resilience. 

Resilience is the ability of a system to withstand disturbances without losing
its function, structure, and hence its identity [@Holling:1973p6861;
@Anonymous:2016fv]. Formally, it is the size of the system's basin of
attraction [@Holling:1973p6861; @Clark:1975vj; @Krakovska:2021ea]. Several
metrics have been used to approximate resilience including the depth of the
basin, slope, distance to the threshold, probability of tipping, resistance,
elasticity, among others [@Krakovska:2021ea]; yet the simplest and
cross-system indicators used are based on recovery time [@Holling:1973p6861;
@Scheffer:2009wl; @Arani:2021iv]. Complex systems when close to critical
transitions leave statistical signatures in the time series of its observables
known as *critical slowing down* [@Strogatz:2014wo; @Scheffer:2012cta;
@Scheffer:2009p4449]. It means that the system takes longer to recover after a
small disturbance, which translates into increases in variance, autocorrelation,
and skewness or flickering [@Scheffer:2009p4449; @Dakos:2015jt]. Similar
indicators exist for spatial data which includes spatial correlations, discrete
Fourier transforms, spatial variance, skewness, power spectrums, and patch-size
distributions [@Kefi:2014dl]. These methods however have some limitations.
They require long time series to detect useful signals [@Dakos:2015jt], and
they can fail when regime shifts are driven by stochastic processes
[@Hastings:2018gy; @Hastings:2010p5336]. 

Recent theoretical and empirical developments have addressed some of these
limitations. On the theoretical front, *critical speeding up* has been proposed
as a suitable alternative to detect stochastically driven critical transitions
[@Titus:2020hb]. While critical slowing down relies on the assumption that
resilience loss is driven by a widening and depth loss of the current basin of
attraction, critical speeding up assumes that the basin shrinks by narrowing the
basin [@Titus:2020hb] (Fig  \ref{fig:ews}). Both techniques pick up resilience loss by measuring
changes in the higher moments of the time series distribution, detecting
sudden increase (decrease) of variance, autocorrelation, skewness or kurtosis.
Another proposed proxy of resilience is the fractal dimension [@West:2017wo;
@West:2010db], which is an indication of self-similarity across scales. The
fractal dimension is related to how adaptable a system is to perturbations, or
how easily it finds modes to deal with disturbances, applications of this are found
in the diagnosis of cardiac disorders [@West:2017wo; @West:2010db] and
engineering [@Pavithran:2021jc]. Exit time has also been proposed as a
resilience indicator, it does however requires high resolution time series with
multiple shifts to render useful insights [@Arani:2021iv]. Autoregressive
state-space models and dynamic linear models are also proposed as alternatives
to generic early warnings which could help circumvent some of their limitations
by calculating changes on the leading eigenvalue in time series, if $\lambda >1$
the time series signals a loss of stability and resilience [@Ives:2012df;
@Taranu:2018dg; @Carpenter:2013cr]. On the empirical realm, recent studies
have pointed to remote sensing products [@Verbesselt:2016hn] and climate
change simulations [@Bathiany:2020cl] as suitable high dimensional datasets
for testing some of these tools in quantifying resilience.

(A) shows three basins derived from the same system under different parameter values where the black basin is more resilience than the other two.

This paper aims to identify where regime shifts are likely to occur by detecting
signals of resilience loss in terrestrial and marine ecosystems primary
productivity. Primary productivity is a proxy of how much living organisms are able to transform solar energy and nutrients into biomass through photosynthesis. Seeing from space, primary productivity is the pulse of life in the biosphere and is typically measured as carbon stored in plants and phytoplankton. This paper applies the traditional early warning signals based on critical
slowing down; and adapts the methods to include critical speeding up metrics,
and fractal dimension (See Methods). To that end, [gross primary
productivity](http://www.fluxcom.org), terrestrial ecosystem respiration, and
[chlorophyll-a concentration](https://esa-oceancolour-cci.org) were used as
proxies of primary productivity of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. These
variables have been harmonized by the [Earth System Data
Lab](https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net), so all data layers share the
same time (weekly) and spatial (0.25 degree) resolution [@Mahecha:2020cl]. To
quantify and compare the change in resilience indicators, the absolute
difference between the maximum and minimum values per indicator was used
($\Delta$, Fig \ref{fig:sm-onepxl}), and a segmented regression was used to
detect changes in slope and break points in the time series (Methods). A series
of logistic and random forest regressions were used to gain insights into what
is driving resilience loss in ecosystems world-wide.

All datasets used are projected with a WGS84 projection (or EPSG:4326) which means that a 0.25 degree resolution pixel is ~27km long at the equator. A rolling window of half the length of the time series is used to calculate the dynamic indicators of resilience. $\Delta$ is the difference between maximum and minimum values, and the black points signal the break point of a segmented regression used to detect whether there are big jumps (increase or decrease) on the resilience indicators (A).

The generic resilience indicators do not necessarily align with critical slowing
down or speeding up theories. Fig \ref{fig:sm-onepxl} illustrates the analysis
for one pixel where all indicators show signals of resilience loss. The time
series is first pre-processed to remove confounding factors such as seasonality
or long term oscillations, log-transformed to reduce the influence of outliers
or shock events, and centered to zero mean and unit variance (Methods). All time
series were first-differenced and passed a unit root test that guarantees
stationarity; in other words, if a signal is detected it is not the product of
residual long-term trends or seasonal variation on the data. The generic
indicators are then calculated by using a rolling window with length equivalent
to 50% of the data. To detect changes in trends of the indicators we used three
approaches. First, $\Delta$ captures the difference between the minimum and
maximum values of the indicator over time. By itself $\Delta$ is not very
informative unless one has its distribution for the entire planet to compare
against (Fig \ref{fig:delta}). In the pixel described in Fig \ref{fig:sm-onepxl} the observed $\Delta$
is indeed on the tail of the distribution for all indicators. Second, a linear
regression was fitted to each indicator to test whether the slopes were
different from zero, but it tends to treat sharp increases or decreases of the
resilience indicators as outliers. Hence, the third approach was a segmented
regression, enabling the detection of a point in time where there is a
significant change on the slope of two linear regressions. The summary of the
analysis for all pixels across all datasets shows that only in few cases
autocorrelation and variance increase or decrease in tandem, the signatures of
critical slowing down or speeding up. In contrast, large values of $\Delta$,
interpreted here as symptoms of resilience loss, are detected in several
different arrangements, most commonly in the agreement between kurtosis and
skewness.

Ecosystems world-wide are showing symptoms of resilience loss. The absolute
difference in resilience indicators ($\Delta$) emphasizes jumps in the time
series and enables comparison with normal variation adjusted to each biome type.
Arctic ecosystems such as boreal forests, taiga and tundra show the strongest
signals of resilience loss globally (Fig \ref{fig:gpp}, \ref{fig:ter}). However,
the extremes of the distributions (5% and 95% percentiles) of each resilience
proxy reveal that all ecosystems are losing resilience, for some of them up to
30% of their global area using the gross primary productivity or terrestrial
ecosystem respiration data sets (Fig \ref{fig:sm-gpp}, \ref{fig:sm-ter}).
Despite data incompleteness for marine ecosystems at high latitudes, some
signals of resilience loss are detected in Arctic marine systems and the
Southern Ocean (Fig \ref{fig:mar}, \ref{fig:sm-mar}). The Easter Indo-Pacific
and Tropical Eastern Pacific Oceans are the marine realms with larger areas
showing symptoms of resilience loss (Fig \ref{fig:mar}). The high oceans (gray area in Fig \ref{fig:mar}),
however, show by far the larger areas affected with hot spots outside the
Caribbean basin in the Tropical Atlantic, the Tropical Pacific and southeast
Madagascar.

\label{fig:perms}
\end{figure*}
```

Symptoms of resilience loss are coherent in space and time. Although the
analysis was done independently for each time series and variable, spatial
aggregation and coincidence of break points in time suggest that the signals are
not artifacts of the data used (Fig \ref{fig:sm-map}, \ref{fig:sm-temp-clus} ,
\ref{fig:sm-temp-cor}). On the contrary, it supports the idea that there are
edges in the three-dimensional space (longitude, latitude and time) that enclose
volumes whose dynamics can shift in tandem [@Bathiany:2020cl]. Resilience
indicators are remarkably consistent across metrics for marine systems both in
space (Fig \ref{fig:sm-mar}) and time (Fig \ref{fig:sm-temp-cor}). There is high
agreement between kurtosis and skewness across all data sets (Figs
\ref{fig:sm-gpp}, \ref{fig:sm-ter}, \ref{fig:sm-mar}); they can signal the
possible shifting of basin of attraction or dynamic transients
[@Scheffer:2009p4449; @Dakos:2015jt].

\caption{\textbf{Model-based indicators} A sample of 100 pixels where resilience loss was detected by at least three indicators is compared against 100 pixels where no signals were detected. The leading eigenvalue of the system is approximated with a dynamic linear autoregressive model}
\label{fig:lambda}
\end{figure*}
```
An alternative interpretation for coherence of signals is spatial and temporal
autocorrelation, or that they are merely responses to shocks on environmental
variables. Potential issues of temporal autocorrelation were dealt with by
processing the data to the point that the remaining time series were stationary
[@ives2021statistical]. Issues of spatial autocorrelation are dealt with (below) by
fitting explanatory models and subsampling in space, while introducing fixed
effects for geography related variables (biome, latitude, longitude). To further
test the robustness of the signals, a subsample of time series of detected
places (N = 500) were compared against the same time series but with the order
of observations changed (10 permutations per time series, 5000 permutations).
When the ordering of observations is lost, the signal of resilience loss
disappears, meaning it has e.g. a significantly lower autocorrelation and
standard deviation on the absolute value scale (Fig \ref{fig:perms}). A Wilcoxon
two-sided test, comparing the distributions of permutations against observed data,
suggests that the means are indeed different (p \<\< 0.05 for all comparisons).
Thus, the results are not merely noise induced by outliers (e.g. shocks) because
the same time series with the same outliers but different ordering does not show
the early warnings to the same extent as the observed data. On the contrary,
for some statistics like autocorrelation and standard deviation, their $\Delta$
values go back to what is expected to be normal (the global medium range, see i.e., Figs \ref{fig:delta}, or the insets in \ref{fig:sm-gpp}, \ref{fig:sm-ter}, \ref{fig:sm-mar} for all variables).

An additional robustness test is comparing the generic indicators against
model-based early warnings. The former are statistical trends that do not necessarily account for mechanisms and can be vulnerable to false positives and false negatives. The latter are auto regressive dynamic linear models
that enable fitting coefficients that change over time, in particular the
approximation of the leading eigenvalue of the system $\lambda$ [@Ives:2012df;
@Taranu:2018dg; @Carpenter:2013cr]. The leading eigenvalue is a much stronger indicator that the system is stable or not, if $\lambda > 1$ it is a signature that the system is going away from equilibrium, possibly an alternative state or a dynamic transient. For each data set a sample of a hundred
pixels was randomly drawn for detected places with at least three different
resilience indicators, and compared against places that showed no early warning
(Fig \ref{fig:lambda}). Model-based indicators showed resilience loss for at
least half of the sample of chlorophyll A and a third of the sample of gross
primary productivity. For places where $\lambda < 0$ the distribution still
shows a displacement towards one when compared to places with no signals. For
terrestrial ecosystem respiration however, model-based early warnings do not
support the patterns found by the generic indicators.

The best model for gross primary productivity targeted node size 10 and 12 variables to split at each node (N = 31122, OOB error 0.13), 20 node size and 9 variables for terrestrial ecosystem respiration (N = 29546, OOB error 0.14), and 20 node size and 9 variables for chlorophyll A (N = 54298, OOB error 0.16). }

If resilience is approximated as the size of the basin of attraction, critical
slowing down is sensible to reductions in depth while critical speeding up is sensible
to reductions in width (Fig \ref{fig:ews}). However, these theories when applied to ecological
problems are typically approached as low dimensional models with perhaps one
controlling factor, one driver. Recent experimental evidence suggests that when
ecosystems are subject to multiple drivers, early warning indicators can fail or
provide contradictory signals [@Dai:2015dwa]. Lack of consistency between
signals suggests that there is no one preferred theory at place. But instead,
multiple drivers are interacting in pushing ecosystems outside their realm of
stability, some of them through increasing stochasticity while others through
slow forcing.

To test that hypothesis, I used logistic regressions and random forests to
investigate what is driving the detection of early warnings. Detection by at
least two proxies of resilience loss was used as a response variable. Explanatory
variables for terrestrial ecosystems included time series of temperature,
precipitation, burned area, and land cover. For marine systems, the explanatory
variables were restricted to sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity.
Variables with long and frequent time series (temperature, salinity and
precipitation) were filtered with a Fourier transform to test whether the
signals are predicted by long term variation, annual cycles, fast oscillations,
or the linear (slow) trends. All regressions used a stratified sampling design,
balanced on detection, and with fixed effects per biomes or marine realm
respectively (See Method). The subsampling is necessary to control for two
sources of bias. First, it breaks biases induced by spatial autocorrelation and
the potential inflation of effects or small standard errors
[@ives2021statistical]. Second, it reduces bias by a relatively larger amount of
pixels were resilience loss is not detected, or by biomes that naturally have
larger areas.

The strongest predictors of resilience loss are indeed a combination of slow
forcing and stochasticity in environmental variables such as temperature,
precipitation or sea surface salinity. For terrestrial biomes, mean
temperature, mean precipitation and variability in fast oscillations and annual
cycles are the strongest predictors, while marine realms are predicted by mean
temperature, mean salinity and their variability at different time scales (Fig
\ref{fig:reg}). The logistic regression facilitates a relatively straightforward
interpretation [@Kuhn:2013vn]. Once geography and biome type has been
controlled for, the reminder coefficients indicate what increases the odds of
detecting resilience loss. However, this linear approach suffers from
correlations in the predictors, namely the different time scales at which the
hypothesis needs to be tested, whether it is slow forcing or stochasticity at
different time scales what drives the signals. In fact, the predicting accuracy
for the logistic regression is poor (area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve ROC 0.71, 0.65 and 0.59 for gross primary productivity,
terrestrial ecosystem respiration and chlorophyll A respectively). The random
forest approach leads to higher predictive power (ROC 0.893, 0.874, 0.827
respectively). It is robust to potential correlations and required less
pre-processing for feature engineering but is less amenable to interpretation
[@Kuhn:2013vn]. It reveals which variables improve predictions but not
necessarily in which direction they are affecting resilience loss. The results
of both approaches confirm the hypothesis that resilience loss is driven by a
combination of slow forcing and stochasticity on potential drivers.


# Discussion

Resilience is the ability of any system to deal with change while keeping its
structure and functions, thus its identity [@Holling:1973p6861;
@Anonymous:2016fv]. The dynamic indicators used here approximate resilience as
recovery time [@Scheffer:2009p4449; @Titus:2020hb], and for the fractal
dimension a collection of behaviors available to deal with disturbance
[@West:2017wo]. These metrics, however, do not directly inform about other
dimensions of resilience such as the size of the basin of attraction, the amount
of disturbance that the system can stand, the mean return time, the distance to
tipping points and thresholds, or adaptive and transformative capacities
[@Krakovska:2021ea; @Anonymous:2016fv]. The indicators here used can be seen
as symptoms of instabilities being developed on the time series of primary
productivity for global ecosystems over the past two decades. The symptoms do
not imply imminent regime shifts, they help identify places where their
probability is increasing given the limitations of the data. The data is
relatively short to account for critical transitions in the biosphere, yet it is
one of the best observational records to approximate resilience globally. These
symptoms are necessary but not sufficient evidence of unfolding regime shifts.
Yet, the analysis here presented enables the identification of areas vulnerable
to regime shifts at a scale relevant to decision makers.

Globally 29% of terrestrial biomes and 24% of marine realms show signals of
resilience loss in at least one of the indicators used (Fig. \ref{fig:gpp},
\ref{fig:mar}, \ref{fig:ter}). The overall patterns here reported agree with
recent reports documenting ecosystems' degradation worldwide. Forests are
becoming more vulnerable to droughts, and the combined effects with increasing
fire frequency are exposing them to major diebacks expected by mid-century
[@Williams:2013iy]. Temperature thresholds for terrestrial primary
productivity have been identified [@Duffy:2021br; @Johnston:2021fg] where
carbon uptake is potentially degraded (sink to source transition). Less than 10%
of the terrestrial biosphere has already crossed the threshold, and under
business-as-usual scenarios, half of the biosphere is expected to cross these
thresholds by the end of the century, with the most affected areas being
Canadian and Russian boreal taigas as well as the Amazon and South East Asia
rainforests [@Duffy:2021br]. These are biomes where the strongest signals of
resilience loss were detected with a right shift on the distribution of
$|\Delta|$. Other studies quantifying terrestrial ecosystems' resilience with NDVI
data also show strong signals from tundra and boreal forests [@Feng:2021gr].
A recent quantification of aridity thresholds shows that up to 28.6% of current
dryland area can cross these thresholds by 2100 in the most drastic climate
scenarios [@Berdugo:2020kk]. The results here presented confirm early warning
signals of resilience loss in drylands as well, particularly with the fractal
dimension, skewness and kurtosis (Fig. \ref{fig:sm-gpp}, \ref{fig:sm-ter}).

The marine patterns presented here also align with previous studies. Deepening
of the ocean's mixed layer can decrease light conditions near the surface,
decreasing nutrient exchange in the water column and consequently primary
productivity [@Sallee:2021ju]. The area outside the Caribbean basin
reported here coincides with an area where salinity has contributed to ocean
stratification [@Sallee:2021ju]. Upwelling systems are also hotspots where
resilience loss is identified. Upwelling strength is expected to change with
climate change, with strengthening already reported in the California and
Benguela currents, while weakening in the Iberian-Canary system
[@Sydeman:2014dh]. Upwelling weakening can limit nutrients in marine food
webs, while strengthening can over enrich nutrients and facilitate the onset of
oxygen minimum zones [@Breitburg:2018iz]. This study provides an additional
line of support that these systems are being destabilized.

The results are limited by the temporal and spatial scale of the available data.
If the grain of the data is not frequent enough to match fast dynamics, long
enough to capture change in slow processes [@Arani:2021iv;
@Scheffer:2009p4449; @Dakos:2015jt], or the spatial resolution is too coarse,
local transitions in space and time can be missed. This is the case with hypoxic
areas, where large oxygen minimum zones are identified, but not the diverse
range of smaller local cases that have been previously reported [@Breitburg:2018iz]. Only regime
shifts that are drastic enough to change primary productivity as observed from
remote sensing products can be identified. Regime shifts that impact specific
populations or community assemblies without changing primary productivity are
missed. Such is the case of coral transitions in the Great Barrier Reef where
\~50% of the reef community collapsed following the heatwave events of 2016-17
[@Hughes:2018ba].

Because of these limitations, the results likely are an underestimation. The
estimates are also conservative, with an arbitrary 5% and 95% quantile of the
$\Delta$ distribution as detection threshold. A lower cutoff would enlarge the
areas where resilience loss is detected, but also increase the risk of false
positives. A similar study using NDVI data estimated up to \~65% of terrestrial
ecosystems show early warning of critical transitions, with strong bias towards
boreal forest and taiga [@Feng:2021gr]. The estimates presented here
complement previous efforts [@Feng:2021gr; @Verbesselt:2016hn] in taking
into consideration fixed effects by biome and a pre-processing technique that
removes seasonality and long-term variations that can lead to errors, or bias
towards high variable environments (higher latitudes).

Another limitation of this study is the lack of ground truthing. The results
provide a spatial prediction of where ecosystems might be losing their
resilience. But since critical transitions have not happened yet in many of
these places, it is not possible to contrast the models presented here with
their real predicting power. Current databases that track such transitions are
biased to studies and observations on the global north and coastal ecosystems
[@Breitburg:2018iz; @Biggs:2018hx], their coverage is not yet sufficient to
be used as ground truth across all ecosystems and biomes. Nevertheless, the
robustness of the signals detected were tested against null permutation models
and model-based early warnings. The first test showed the signals are not an
artifact of the data, potential temporal autocorrelation was dealt with
stringent data pre-processing and randomizing the ordering of observations. The
second test supported our findings for chlorophyll A and gross primary
productivity, but failed in supporting the findings of terrestrial ecosystem
respiration.

Model-based approaches such as autoregressive time varying models can help
interpreting the results and robustness of generic indicators [@Ives:2012df;
@Taranu:2018dg; @Carpenter:2013cr]. In this study, these methods gave
stronger confidence to the results from gross primary productivity and less
support to terrestrial ecosystem respiration derived signals, although both
results qualitatively point to the same patterns. The combination of methods
thus helped distinguish what are optimal observables of resilience loss, an open
question and possibly a fruitful avenue for future research [@Dakos:2015jt].
Unfortunately, model-based methods are computationally expensive and do not scale
up to the data requirements of remote sensing products, on the order of $10^5$
to $10^7$ spatial pixels (depending on spatial resolution) times time series
length. Generic indicators are still useful in narrowing down the scope at which
computationally expensive methods become practical.

Computing the probability density function of $\Delta$ helps interpreting
signals of resilience loss. Previous work using generic indicators typically
have ground truth in the form of modeling simulations with some noise or actual
experiments. Because the ground truth is known, there was not concern whether
the magnitude of the increase (decrease) in early warnings was big enough to actually
be considered a warning. Here we do not have ground truth like experiments, but
we can compute the distribution of each indicator for the entire planet enabling
the comparison of what constitutes a big jump on an indicator as opposed to its
normal expected variability for each biome (Fig \ref{fig:delta}). The magnitude depends on the
indicator and data pre-processing choices, but the position of the pixel in the
distribution is relatively unaffected. Thus, $\Delta$ is less sensitive to
pre-processing choices. While in theory increases or decreases on a particular
statistic can be interpreted as resilience loss (an apparent contradiction), the
distribution of $\Delta$ helps interpreting whether an increase or decrease is
towards the tails of the distribution (resilience loss) as opposed to an
increase or decrease towards the center of the distribution (a resilience gain).
The fractal dimension here introduced is unambiguous and do not depend on scale,
for time series it is bounded between 1 and 2 and higher values are always more
resilient [@West:2017wo; @Gneiting:2012be]. Future studies can use these two
facts to track ecological recovery.

Despite its limitations, this first-order approximation to resilience loss
can help outline priority areas for management. Russia, Canada, the US, and
Australia are countries with the largest areas of resilience loss identified,
yet by proportion of territory, small island states top the ranking. When
accounting for the diversity of ecosystems showing signs of resilience loss,
megadiverse countries like Brazil, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Australia, or
Colombia are on the top 10 (Fig \ref{fig:sm-countries}). Australia has recently
been reported as a hotspot for ecological collapses for both marine and
terrestrial ecosystems [@Bergstrom:2021ey]. The spatial resolution of the
maps here presented enable countries, regions, and even municipalities to update
land use planning and take the vulnerability of their
ecosystems into consideration. Companies for example, can take such risk into account when deciding
on relocation, resource outsourcing, or investments. Countries and
municipalities can balance the trade-off between maximizing a particular
ecosystem service (e.g. food production) in favour of multifunctional landscapes
that include other values such as recreation, spiritual values or conservation.
No matter the scale, we all have a role to play in caring for ecosystems
resilience and maintaining their ability to provide the ecosystem services we
all depend on.

Future global resilience assessments could benefit from other data streams,
particularly other anthropogenic drivers overlooked here. Answering the question of resilience of what to what will require observations in several ecological and social data streams. For example, longer recovery time might be related to more frequent and intense perturbations (rate induced tipping), not necessarily reductions on the basin of attraction size [@ashwin2012tipping]. Recent qualitative reviews on regime shifts drivers diversity show that no regime shift is caused by single drivers. Multiple drivers often interact in non-random patterns where food production, nutrient cycling, climate change and urbanization co-occur strongly [@Rocha:2018gn; @Rocha:2015du]. Additional data would
however require long time series coverage and high spatial resolution. The
accuracy of the predictive models presented here can be improved by using
non-linear approaches such as deep neural networks or other machine learning
techniques [@Reichstein:2019ii]. However, these approaches have limited
interpretability and often require manually annotated data sets to measure
performance. Qualitative efforts such as the Global Ocean Oxygen Network
[@Breitburg:2018iz] or the Regime Shifts Database [@Biggs:2018hx] can
provide the annotated examples to train such models. A spatially explicit map of
resilience loss can also help quantify the risk of cascading effects in
ecosystems previously identified [@Rocha:2018gn]. As new Earth observations
become available, these global maps can be updated and track how ecosystems
resilience is evolving, where are they recovering and where they are becoming more
vulnerable. This paper showcases the first steps toward an ecological resilience
observatory.

# Methods

*Data:* [Gross primary productivity](http://www.fluxcom.org), terrestrial
ecosystem respiration (both in $gCm^{-2}d^{-1}$), and [chlorophyll-a
concentration](https://esa-oceancolour-cci.org) ($mgm^{-3}$) were used as
proxies of primary productivity of terrestrial and marine ecosystems
respectively [@Jung:2019hr; @bg-13-4291-2016; @Sathyendranath:2019hs].
Although these data sets are freely available through the FLUXCOM initiative
(<http://www.fluxcom.org>) or the European Space Agency Climate Change
initiative (<https://climate.esa.int/>), the versions of the data used here
were harmonized by the [Earth System Data
Lab](https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net) to weekly observations at 0.25 degree
grid resolution, and stored as [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)
data cubes to facilitate out of memory computations [@Mahecha:2020cl]. Gross
primary productivity and terrestrial ecosystem respiration time series span the
period 2001-2018 resulting in 210 771 terrestrial pixels with 817 time
observations each, while chlorophyll A span the period 1998-2018 resulting in
418 776 time series with 966 observations each. The Nature Conservancy
classification of terrestrial biomes and ecosystems was used (16 biomes, 812
ecosystems) based on [@Olson:2001ju], while marine realms (N=12) followed
[@Spalding:2007ga] classification.

*Pre-processing:* The [Earth System Data
Lab](https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net) is hosted by the Max Planck Institute
of Biogeochemestry and Brockmann Consult GmbH with the support of the European
Space Agency. Their computing services were used to pre-process the data in
their `Julia` environment. For each of the resulting time series, missing data
was inputted with the mean seasonal cycle. A fast Fourier transform was used to
filter the time series and remove the trend, annual cycle, and long-term
variability. The remaining fast oscillations were log-transformed and normalized
to zero mean and unit variance. The cleaned data was exported and further
statistical analysis performed in `R`. A unit root test showed that a few time
series were not stationary after the pre-processing steps described. Thus all
time series were first-differenced to remove any remaining seasonality.

*Proxies of resilience:* At this point all time series are expected to have zero
mean and unit variance. Resilience loss is here detected by measuring critical
slowing down or speeding up in terms of sharp increase (decrease) of variance
measured as standard deviation, autocorrelation coefficient at lag-1; or proxies
of flickering such as skewness, and kurtosis. Fractal dimensions were calculated
using the madogram method [@Gneiting:2012be]. All these statistics were
calculated in rolling windows half of the size of the time series available.
$\Delta$ is the difference between maximum and minimum values of the resilience
indicators considering time ordering (thus allowing negative values).
For standard deviation and autocorrelation at lag-1, a positive $\Delta$ can
indicate critical slowing down or speeding up if negative. The value of
$\Delta$ however is not informative by itself. The magnitude depends on the
pre-processing choices. Other researchers prefer a Gaussian filter, or kernel
based methods to pre-process time series. These methods, however, require
arbitrary choices that can optimize for detection of certain biomes while under-estimating for others. Because the data analyzed spanned about two decades,
care should be taken to avoid bias on the resilience indicator by seasonal
variability, annual cycles or multidecadal oscillations. For these reasons the
Fourier transform was an ideal filter for this study, returning zero mean and
unit variance fast oscillations regardless of whether the time series comes from a
strong seasonal biome (e.g. boreal forest) or weak seasonality (e.g. tropical
ones). The value of $\Delta$ varies, however, with window size, the smaller the
rolling window, the larger $\Delta$ becomes. What matters, however, is not the
absolute value of $\Delta$ but its position relative to the distribution for the
planet, and in particular, relative to the biome described (due to the
seasonality differences). $\Delta$ has a bimodal distribution (because zero
differences are very unlikely), and outliers with respect to each biome
distribution were reported as places showing symptoms of resilience loss.
Outliers are here defined as places where $\Delta$ is unusually extreme, either
above the 95% or below the 5% quantiles of $\Delta$ distribution.

To check for the spatial and temporal coherence across time series, a segmented
regression [@Muggeo:2003go] was used to identify the breaking point at which
the early warning is detected. The segmented regression departed from a linear
fit of the resilience proxy against time, the median of the indicator was used
as starting value, and only one break point was calculated by default. A Davis
tested for the significant difference in slopes before and after the breaking
point. Since the time series are normalized, the expectation is no difference in
variance and hence no detection of breaking points. If there is a breaking point
and the difference is significant and large, one can expect the signal to be a
warning of resilience loss, specially in the case where other neighboring areas
show similar signals in space and time. The statistical detection treats each
time series independently, but spatial and temporal coherence of the signal
offers supporting evidence for true detection in the absence of annotated data
or ground truth. An additional line of support can be explored by training
models that exploit information about potential causes of abrupt changes in
ecosystems to predict the detection (or lack) of resilience loss.

*Regressions:* To further test the robustness of the results and explore what is
driving resilience loss, a logistic regression and a random forest were fitted
to classify pixels where at least two metrics suggested loss of resilience.
Explanatory variables included air temperature at 2m
(<https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/ecv-for-climate-changee>),
sea surface temperature [@Merchant:2019fs]
(<https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/sea-surface-temperature>), precipitation
(<https://gpm.nasa.gov/data>), sea surface salinity
(<https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ocean-colour>), burned area
(<http://www.globalfiredata.org>), and land cover change
(<https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover>). For
all variables, except land cover, the available data match the temporal
resolution of the data used as proxy of primary productivity, but not
necessarily time span. Thus, a Fourier transform was used to pre-process the
data and separate the linear trend, seasonal cycle, annual cycle and fast
oscillations. For temperature, precipitation and salinity, their mean value,
slope of the linear trend and the standard deviation of the seasonal cycle,
annual cycle and fast oscillations were used as regressors. This is with the
intention of testing whether resilience loss is driven by variability at
different time scales or changes in slow processes. Land cover data has a higher
spatial resolution (300m) but lower temporal resolution (year). Proportion of
change per land cover class between 1994 and 2018 were calculated and aggregated
at 0.25 degree grid. Burnt area is the aggregated area burned in hectares during
2001-2018 per pixel.

For logistic regressions, the data was down sampled on the detection variable
(at least two variables indicating resilience loss), after filtering out rock
and ice biomes, log-transforming burnt area, performing a box-cox transformation
on land cover change variables, and normalizing to zero mean and unit variance
all numeric predictors. Random forest, being more tolerant to variables on their
natural units, were fitted after filtering out rock and ice biomes and down
sampling on detection. 75% of the data was used for training and tuning hyper
parameters using 10-fold cross validation. All random forests were fitted with
1000 trees. Best models were assessed against the testing data (25%) and
variable importance computed with permutation. The best model for gross primary
productivity targeted node size 10 and 12 variables to split at each node (N =
31122, OOB error 0.13), 20 node size and 9 variables for terrestrial ecosystem
respiration (N = 29546, OOB error 0.14), and 20 node size and 9 variables for
chlorophyll A (N = 54298, OOB error 0.16).
