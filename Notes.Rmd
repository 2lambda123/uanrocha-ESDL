Next steps:

1. Add permutation test, check if it breaks the pattern of EWS. Main test would be comparing the $\Delta$ statistic.
2. Play with minimal model that reproduces CSU and CSD. Plot potential. Combine models to show that the potential can shring in two dimensions and that would make one type of signal fail.
3. Re-compute using the netCDF files, make sure it works on your machine.
